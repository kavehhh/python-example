MicroDonuts: An OpenTelemetry Walkthrough
=========================================


Welcome to MicroDonuts! This is a sample application and OpenTelemetry
walkthrough, written in Python.

OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral, open standard for distributed tracing. To
learn more, check out http://opentelemetry.io, and try the walkthrough below!

**Note that there are two git branches of note here.**

#. First, ``git checkout master`` illustrates a trivial multi-service app with cross-service tracing via OpenTelemetry
#. Second, ``git checkout no-tracing`` removes the tracing instrumentation, allowing the reader to add it in themselves

Step 0: Setup MicroDonuts
=========================

Getting it
----------

#. Install ``virtualenv``: ``sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv``
#. Create a virtual environment: ``mkdir microdonuts; virtualenv microdonuts``
#. Activate the virtual environment: ``source microdonuts/bin/activate``
#. Clone this repository
#. Install the dependencies ``pip3 install -r python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/requirements.txt``

Running
-------

#. ``python3 python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/walkthrough/server.py``
#. Open your web browser, navigate to ``http://127.0.0.1:8082`` and order yourself some Âµ-donuts.

MicroDonuts has 4 server endpoints:

#. ``/order``
#. ``/status``
#. ``/kitchen/add_donuts``
#. ``/kitchen/get_donuts``

The first 2 serve orders, the last 2 provide kitchen services.

Step 1: Check out the ``no-tracing`` branch
-------------------------------------------

The ``master`` branch in this repository has tracing instrumentation added as
described below. To maximize your learnings, do a...

.. code:: bash

    git checkout no-tracing

...to start with a version of the code that's not instrumented yet. The guide
below will let you learn-by-doing as you re-introduce that tracing
instrumentation.

Step 2: Turnkey Tracing
-----------------------

When you go to add tracing to a system, the best place to start is by
installing OpenTelemetry plugins for the OSS components you are using.
Instrumenting your networking libraries, web frameworks, and service clients
quickly gives you a lot of information about your distributed system, without
requiring you to change a lot of code.

To do this, let's change the startup of the application to include tracing:
``cd python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/walkthrough``

Start the global tracer
.......................

In OpenTelemetry, there is a concept of a global tracer for everyone to access.

Accessing this global tracer is easy, just add these lines to ``server.py`` under
``BLOCK 0``:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry import trace, propagators
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import Tracer
    from opentelemetry.sdk.context.propagation.b3_format import B3Format

Add these lines under ``BLOCK 1`` too:

.. code:: python

    trace.set_preferred_tracer_implementation(lambda T: Tracer())

    propagators.set_global_httptextformat(B3Format())

    tracer = trace.tracer()

The global tracer is now available as ``tracer``.


Instrument the HTTP requests
............................

This is done in an automatic way by just adding this line under ``BLOCK 0``:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry.ext.http_requests import enable

Add also this line under ``BLOCK 1``:

.. code:: python

    enable(tracer)

Instrument Flask
................

This example uses Flask to expose the HTTP endpoints. Flask code can
be traced automatically by adding this line under ``BLOCK 0``:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry.ext.wsgi import OpenTelemetryMiddleware

Add this line under ``BLOCK 2`` also:

.. code:: python

    app.wsgi_app = OpenTelemetryMiddleware(app.wsgi_app)

Add an exporter
...............

An exporter is necessary for the span data to be displayed. We'll use the
``ConsoleExporter`` in this example, an exporter that simply prints the span data
into the console. Add these lines under ``BLOCK 0``:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleExportSpanProcessor

Add this line under ``BLOCK 1``:

.. code:: python

    tracer.add_span_processor(
        SimpleExportSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
    )

Use the tracer
..............

Now is time to use the tracer itself in the server code.

Change the ``order`` function to this:

.. code:: python

    @app.route('/order', methods=['POST'])
    def order():

        order_id = str(uuid4())

        with tracer.start_span('root_span'):

            for donut_data in loads(next(request.form.keys()))['donuts']:

                for _ in range(donut_data['quantity']):

                    kitchen_consumer.add_donut(donut_data, order_id)

            return kitchen_consumer.check_status(order_id)

Change the ``status`` function to this:

.. code:: python

    @app.route('/status', methods=['POST'])
    def status():

        with tracer.start_span('status_span'):

            return kitchen_consumer.check_status(
                loads(next(request.form.keys()))['order_id']
            )

This will automatically create a span every time each of these functions are
called.

Step 3: Have fun
----------------

You can run the walkthrough again as explained before. You should see the span
data displayed in the console.

Thanks for playing, and welcome to OpenTelemetry!
